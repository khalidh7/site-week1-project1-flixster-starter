### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video or gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (üö´ Remove this paragraph after adding walkthrough video)

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe the topics discussed in our labs were related to the steps and featured required for this project. For example the first lab helped us with HTMl, second lab with javascript, and third lab with apis.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have cleaned up code a bit more. Also I would have like to work on the popup feature.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think that I did well on my project demo. I showed off the functionality, accessibility, and personalization of the website. Something I would like to do next time is a more structured presentation. Something I noticed that a peer did that I liked was use the ftl/codepath theme for the presentation. 

### Open-source libraries used

No open source libraries used.

### Shout out

I think everyone who was asking me questions helped me a lot. By answering questions and looking at other people's code, I became more comfortable with the technologies used.
